After using remote desktop to log into my jobs print server (I did not do that here but that is what would need to happen) goint to windows start, typing/opening print management, right clicking on the print server (which would be the jobs server) I can click to add the users printer whhile on call. </p> </p>

After clicking add printer, it would take me here where I would add the printer by IP address. <p/> <p/>

Here is were I would put the IP address from the user while on the call. Then I would put the correct driver for the printer model which I would ask the user for the model of the printer, ask for the name, share this printer, and click finish.after adding the users printer I would then right click on the users printer name and open printe queue to see any jobs stuck in the queue. If there is a job stuck there I would right click the job, when the pop appears I can click cancle to remove all jobs stuck. After clearing the queue I can send the job back and ask if the users printer is working again.
